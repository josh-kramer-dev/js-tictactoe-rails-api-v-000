// Code your JavaScript / jQuery solution here
// button#save
// Clicking this button should save the current game state. If the current game already exists in the database, saving it should update that previously-saved game. If the current game has not yet been persisted to the database, saving it should do so. As a brief example, if we start with a blank board that has not been saved and click button#save, the current game should be persisted to our database. If we then click button#save a second time, the persisted game should be updated (though, since we have yet to make any moves, the board will still be blank in the updated game state).

// need to get elementById("save") and on('click', function(state){update the state});
